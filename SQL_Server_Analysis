You can perform various types of analysis on the Library Books table in SQL Server using SQL queries. Here are some examples of common analyses you can do along with explanations and sample SQL code: 

Count the Number of Books in the Library: This analysis helps you determine the total number of books available in the library. 

SQL code 

SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalBooks 
FROM [MAC_SMS].[jlibrary].[Books]; 
 

List Books by Author: This analysis lists books by their authors, allowing you to see how many books each author has in the library. 

SQL code 

SELECT Author, COUNT(*) AS TotalBooks 
FROM [MAC_SMS].[jlibrary].[Books] 
GROUP BY Author 
ORDER BY TotalBooks DESC; 
 

Calculate the Average Book Price: This analysis helps you find the average price of books in the library. 

SQL code 

SELECT AVG(Item_price) AS AveragePrice 
FROM [MAC_SMS].[jlibrary].[Books]; 
 

Identify the Most Common Publishers: This analysis identifies the publishers with the highest number of books in the library. 

SQL code 

SELECT Publisher, COUNT(*) AS TotalBooks 
FROM [MAC_SMS].[jlibrary].[Books] 
GROUP BY Publisher 
ORDER BY TotalBooks DESC; 
 

Find Books by Subject: This analysis allows you to find books based on their subject. 

SQL code 

SELECT Book_Title, Subject 
FROM [MAC_SMS].[jlibrary].[Books] 
WHERE Subject = 'YourSubject'; 
 

Calculate the Total Cost of Books by Publisher: This analysis helps you determine the total cost of books from each publisher. 

SQL code 

SELECT Publisher, SUM(Item_price) AS TotalCost 
FROM [MAC_SMS].[jlibrary].[Books] 
GROUP BY Publisher 
ORDER BY TotalCost DESC; 
 

Identify the Most Expensive Books: This analysis lists the most expensive books in the library. 

SQL code 

SELECT Book_Title, Item_price 
FROM [MAC_SMS].[jlibrary].[Books] 
ORDER BY Item_price DESC 
LIMIT 10; 
 

Group Books by Room Number: This analysis groups books by their room numbers to see how they are distributed across different rooms. 

SQL code 

SELECT Room_No, COUNT(*) AS TotalBooks 
FROM [MAC_SMS].[jlibrary].[Books] 
GROUP BY Room_No 
ORDER BY Room_No; 
 

These are just a few examples of the types of analysis you can perform on your library books table using SQL Server. Depending on your specific requirements and the data in your table, you can create more complex queries to gain deeper insights into your library's collection.
