# Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, SPSS, and Excel. Each project represents a unique set of challenges and solutions, showcasing my expertise in data analysis, data visualization, and more.

## Python

In my Python projects, I leverage the power of data analysis libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to extract insights and create meaningful visualizations from data. I use Python for tasks such as data cleaning, exploration, machine learning, and automation.

## SQL

SQL is my go-to tool for working with databases. I have experience in writing complex SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from various database management systems. Whether it's data retrieval, data modeling, or optimization, SQL plays a vital role in my data projects.

## Power BI

Power BI is my choice for creating interactive and insightful data dashboards. I use Power BI to visualize data, perform in-depth analysis, and provide actionable insights for decision-makers. These dashboards help turn data into actionable information.

## SPSS

SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) is a valuable tool for conducting statistical analysis. I have experience in using SPSS to perform hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and various other statistical techniques to derive valuable insights from data.

## Excel

Excel is a versatile tool for data management and analysis. I utilize Excel for tasks like data cleaning, data transformation, basic analysis, and creating informative charts and graphs. Excel is often an essential part of data projects.
